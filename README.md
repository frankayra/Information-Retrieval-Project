# Information-Retrieval-Project

Project designed for retrieving information from local files and shows it in a friendly interface imitating Google's.
It has 2 models, vectorial and boolean. To use them, intuitively we can change it in the top of the interface, as well.

> **Vectorial Model**: It has some formulas, which are used for calculate the relevance of a document related to a specific query, it use measurement formulas like **tf** and **idf** for the mentioned purpose.

> **Boolean Model**: It is a particular case of the vectorial model. It measure the relevance of a term, only having a table of ocurrence for each document for each term.
